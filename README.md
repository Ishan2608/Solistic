# Solistic

A one stop platform for all space enthusiasts to stay updated on latest trends, news, and event of the cosmos. They also get to explore the solar system in our simulator and explore the image gallery from sources like Hubble and Mars Rover.

The project has started developing as of 28th April 2025 by some college students, enthusiastic about building something... `Cool`.

This is a work in progress and will see major updates over time.
